; The MUL subroutine
MUL: LDAX B    ; Load A with the element from the first matrix (B points to the first matrix)
    MOV C, A  ; Copy the value to C
    INX D     ; Move to the corresponding element in the second matrix (DE points to the second matrix)
    LDAX D    ; Load A with the element from the second matrix
    XCHG      ; Exchange the values in A and C
    MVI H, 02H ; Initialize H as the loop counter

MULLOOP: ADD C     ; Add the value in C to A (A += C)
    DCR H     ; Decrement H (loop counter)
    JNZ MULLOOP ; Repeat the multiplication loop until H becomes zero
    RET

; The ADD subroutine for summing the elements of the result matrix
